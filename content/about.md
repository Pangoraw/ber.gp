### Why?

I built this personal website in order to share articles and blog posts about interesting topics. This is also a good way for me to make persistent notes I would like to find later which could be useful for others.

### How?

This website is built using mainly open source software listed above in no particular order:

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) for static rendering
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling
- [GitHub](https://github.com) for source hosting
- [Netlify](https://netlify.com) to host the static files on the web

I was able to use TailwindCSS with Hugo by looking at [this hugo theme](https://bento-hugo-theme.netlify.app/).
