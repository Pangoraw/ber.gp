I contributed to several Open Source Software in the recent years, it was mainly because I was using them or because I found the project interesting and wanted to learn more about it. <!--more--> Some of these projects are:

- [MontFerret/ferret](https://github.com/MontFerret/ferret): Ferret is a scripting language written in Go to scrape websites and interact with a headless chromium instance
- [TuskyApp/tusky](https://github.com/TuskyApp/tusky): Tusky is an Android client for the distributed social media Mastodon
- [Superpowers/superpowers-core](https://github.com/Superpowers/superpowers-core): Superpowers is an HTML5 engine written in Typescript to create games/websites/... in collaboration right in your browser. I also created a [plugin](https://github.com/Pangoraw/superpowers-latex) for Superpowers enabling users to write Latex reports in collaboration.
