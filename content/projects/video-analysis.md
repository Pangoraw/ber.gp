As part of a project similar to the [geometric deep learning analysis](/projects/geometric-dl/) I did in Spring 2020, I investigated state of the art techniques in video action recognition.

The project was mostly about modifying the [SlowFast](https://github.com/facebookresearch/slowfast) model from FAIR to add person tracking. The modifications made to the model are available on [this repository](https://github.com/bdebbabi/slowfast).
